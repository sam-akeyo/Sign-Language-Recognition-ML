## Overview

American Sign Language (ASL) is a vital form of communication for the hearing-impaired. This project is dedicated to developing a computer vision system that can recognize and understand ASL gestures in real-time. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze video input and translate the sign language gestures into equivalent English text. By bridging the communication gap, this system aims to enhance the lives of the hearing-impaired community.
